# Statement of Work: Login Functionality

## Functionality Requirements

- [ ] User can log in with valid credentials (email/password)
- [ ] Backend returns JWT token upon successful login
- [ ] JWT token includes necessary user details (user ID, email)
- [ ] User receives clear error feedback for incorrect credentials

## UI/UX Requirements

### Layout

- [ ] Simple, intuitive layout consistent with Signup form
- [ ] Centrally aligned email and password fields with clear labeling

### Branding

- [ ] Follows established Budgetly brand guidelines (color scheme, typography)
- [ ] Consistency with existing Signup feature in terms of visual design

### Components

- [ ] LoginForm Component
  - [ ] Email input (type=email)
  - [ ] Password input (type=password)
  - [ ] Submit button labeled "Login"
  - [ ] Inline error message display
  - [ ] Show password toggle button
  - [ ] Auto-focus on email field on page load

### UX Considerations

- [ ] Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Immediate, clear feedback provided for incorrect login attempts
- [ ] Loading state indicator during form submission
- [ ] Automatic redirection to /dashboard after successful login

## Implementation Plan

### Backend API Endpoints

- [ ] POST /api/auth/login
  - [ ] Request validation using Zod
  - [ ] Business logic for verifying user credentials
  - [ ] Generate JWT token upon successful verification
  - [ ] JSON response structure includes JWT token, user ID, and email
  - [ ] Proper HTTP status and error responses (400, 401)
  - [ ] Set JWT token in HTTP-only cookie with 24-hour expiration

### Frontend Components

- [ ] LoginForm Component
  - [ ] Props interface clearly defined
  - [ ] State management with React Hook Form and Zod
  - [ ] Event handlers for form submission and error handling
  - [ ] API integration with TanStack Query
  - [ ] Tailwind CSS styling for consistency
  - [ ] Global login state management (React Context/Zustand)

### Integration

- [ ] Secure JWT storage in HTTP-only cookies
- [ ] Integration with backend API
- [ ] Robust frontend error handling
  - [ ] Inline validation errors for form fields
  - [ ] Toast notifications for network errors
  - [ ] Clear error messages for authentication failures

### Testing and Validation

- [ ] Unit tests implemented using Vitest
- [ ] Integration tests using Vitest
- [ ] End-to-end (E2E) tests

## Technical Standards

### Frontend

- React with TypeScript
- React Hook Form
- Zod validation
- TanStack Query
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn UI components
- Vitest for testing
- React Context or Zustand for global state

### Backend

- Express with TypeScript
- Mongoose for MongoDB
- Jest for testing

## Dependencies

### External

- jsonwebtoken
- bcrypt

### Internal

- User schema

### Development

- Vitest
- Jest

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] Users successfully log in with valid credentials
2. [ ] Clear error messages presented to users when login fails
3. [ ] JWT tokens securely generated and functional
4. [ ] Automatic redirection to dashboard after successful login
5. [ ] Proper error handling for all scenarios

## Progress Tracking

### Current Status (2025-05-14)

- [ ] Backend
  - [ ] Login endpoint
  - [ ] JWT integration
- [ ] Frontend
  - [ ] Login form UI
  - [ ] API integration
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Unit and integration testing
  - [ ] End-to-end testing

### Next Steps

1. Start backend API implementation
2. Develop frontend component

## Timeline Estimate

- Backend implementation: 1-2 days
- Frontend implementation: 1-2 days
- Testing phase: 1 day

Total estimated timeline: 4-5 days

## Implementation Clarifications

### JWT Storage

- Use HTTP-only cookies for JWT storage (prevents XSS attacks)
- Token expiration set to 24 hours
- No token refresh required for MVP

### Error Handling

- Specific error messages:
  - Invalid credentials: "Invalid email or password"
  - Network issues: "Unable to connect. Please try again later"
- No rate limiting for MVP
- Network errors shown via toast notifications
- Authentication errors displayed inline with form fields

### Security

- JWT in HTTP-only cookies provides sufficient security for MVP
- No additional CSRF protection required
- Standard Zod validation:
  - Email format validation
  - Password minimum length: 8 characters

### UX Details

- No "Remember me" option (24-hour session sufficient)
- Include "Show password" toggle
- Auto-focus email field on page load

### Integration

- Global state management for login status
- Automatic redirection to /dashboard after login
- No special handling for multiple tabs/windows
- Each tab independently verifies authentication status

## Next Phase

Implementation of Forgot Password functionality and JWT middleware.
